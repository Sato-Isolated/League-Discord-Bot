# League-Discord-Bot
A SlashCommand Bot Discord to show the mmr of the game or of a player using riot api and whatismymmr api

The code is done a bit on the fly if you want to improve it or add functions you can make a PR

When you do a long function like "/checkmmr name mode" it will tell you that the application is not responding on discord
but it will send the command a few seconds later
