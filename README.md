About
A SlashCommand Bot Discord to show the details of a game using [Camille API](https://github.com/MingweiSamuel/Camille)

The code is done a bit on the fly if you want to improve it or add functions you can make a PR

if you have an idea for a function make an issue and I will see what I can do

initially i wanted to make a slash command that would run all the time with a recursion to re-execute the method but it needs a new discord interaction 

for the bot to work you must put your token for the bot discord in program.cs 

your Server ID in InteractionHandler.cs

and your riot api key in LeagueModule.cs
